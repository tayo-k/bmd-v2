# Practicing Better Managed Development

1. Define the available components
2. Categorize your components into capabilities
3. Define the relevant signals for both components and capabilities
4. Develop playbooks or “recipes”:  specific and deliberate combinations of components and capabilities that you will connect to a defined Cultural Outcome.
5. Assign accountability to an individual or groups of individuals for the Outcome

With such defined Cultural Outcomes, an enterprise can
1. 	Deconstruct “culture” into specific cultural outcomes
2. 	Take account of the different perspectives that are relevant in Cultural Governance - cultural outcomes that matter to non-management might not matter to management; technical and non-technical outcomes; senior management and executives etc.
3. 	Provide consistent cultural guidance and execution across teams, managers and geographies
4. 	Provide the workforce with unambiguous guidance with respect to their cultural capacity and vision, including concepts like core values
5. 	Speed up the decision-making process with respect to cultural priorities
6. 	Ensure that they can exercise effective communication and governance over the execution of strategic visions over a long-term period
